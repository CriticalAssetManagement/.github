# Critical Asset Management and Disaster Resilience for Islands, Cities, and Communities
Climate change is increasing the risk of extreme weather events all over the world. Often it is not those responsible for greenhouse emissions who suffer the worst consequences. Island nations, cities, and communities run the risk of devastation from natural disasters, and the governing bodies behind these need to be resilient to disasters to rebuild quickly and save lives.

The open-source Critical Asset Management System (CAMS) project is a collaborative tool being developed through a voluntary effort led by [ARISE-US](https://www.ariseglobalnetwork.org/), a private-sector advisory group to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), and [TerminusDB](https://github.com/terminusdb).

Together, we're building CAMS, **a data-centric tool that displays failure chains of critical assets** to enable effective planning and rapid responses to disasters.

## Seeking contributors
Contribution guide is [here](https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/contributor-guide/blob/main/README.md) - get involved, we are happy to help over in our [community slack](https://join.slack.com/t/camsforclimat-yfe2592/shared_invite/zt-1eni4nvuq-vHlLdrQgVlyY_W7j_SkoEQ).

## The problem to solve
While many cities, communities, and islands seek to improve their disaster resilience by identifying their critical assets, their efforts often suffer from disparate datasets and the inability to map relationships and dependencies between assets programmatically. CAMS is a simple software tool that:

- Enables cities and islands to fully inventory their critical assets and assemble key data about them;
- Identifies the risks to which each asset is exposed;
- Maps the relationships between assets, both spatial and dependency-based;
- Helps to identify potential “failure chains” between them and the risks involved;
- Provides this output to other tools such as emergency control room systems and risk analysis tools.

The tool will provide the functionality to enable communities and nations to improve their disaster resilience to save lives and repair societies faster.


## What We'd Like to Become
A community-oriented map-based, disaster risk information and early warning service with customizable and automated tools to minimize disruptions in service continuity.

An open source map-based information service where users may superimpose assets over basic map data, latest versions of local/national hazard maps, real-time weather information, real-time hazard information, and so on. In addition to receiving early warnings pertaining to their asset, send and receive pre-set messages, alerts, etc. based on pre-set triggers to pre-set recipients, shortening response time, and thus contributing to faster recovery. We could contribute to existing local/national EWS by functioning as aggregator of EWS for decision-makers who must assess disaster risk/threats to extremely large numbers (thousands to tens of thousands) of assets across dispersed and discrete geographical locations. 

A vast number of people globally are dependent of continuation of services for their livelihoods and will need this type of tooling more and more as the climate becomes less predictable. We think an open and independent service like CAMS could make a real difference to people's lives.
