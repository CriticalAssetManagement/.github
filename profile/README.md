# Climate & Disaster Resilience for Islands, Cities, and Communities

If an island's powerplant and communications fail as a result of a hurricane, what is the impact on other critical assets? Can the port operate? Are medical supplies able to reach hospitals? Are hurricane shelters able to communicate with first-responders?

CAMS is an open-source Critical Asset Management System that aims to answer these questions. It is a collaborative tool to enable regions to work together to plot their critical assets on a map and display relationships between them.  

CAMS is **a data-centric tool that displays failure chains of critical assets** to enable effective planning and rapid responses to disasters and we're looking for volunteers to help islands, cities, and communities [solve these problems](https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/.github/blob/main/cams-problem.md).

## Seeking contributors
[Contribution guide is here](https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/contributor-guide/blob/main/README.md) - get involved, we are happy to help over in our [community slack](https://join.slack.com/t/camsforclimat-yfe2592/shared_invite/zt-1eni4nvuq-vHlLdrQgVlyY_W7j_SkoEQ).

[Set up your own instance of CAMS locally](https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/CAMS-Dashboard#getting-started) and familiarize yourself with the application and take a [look at the current roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/CriticalAssetManagement/projects/2) to see where you can help.
