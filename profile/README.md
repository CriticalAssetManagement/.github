# Critical Asset Management and Disaster Resilience for Islands, Cities, and Communities
Climate change is increasing the risk of extreme weather events all over the world. Often it is not those responsible for greenhouse emissions who suffer the worst consequences. Island nations, cities, and communities run the risk of devastation from natural disasters, and the governing bodies behind these need to be resilient to disasters to rebuild quickly and save lives.

The open-source Critical Asset Management System (CAMS) project is a collaborative tool being developed through a voluntary effort led by [ARISE-US](https://www.ariseglobalnetwork.org/), a private-sector advisory group to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), and [TerminusDB](https://github.com/terminusdb).

Together, we're building CAMS, **a data-centric tool that displays failure chains of critical assets** to enable effective planning and rapid responses to disasters.

## Seeking contributors
If you’re looking for an open-source project to contribute to, please consider CAMS. The project includes:

- Technology for good
- Graph database technology
- Document database technology
- Schema design
- Front-end development
- Back-end development
- Machine learning
- Collaboration with a range of people from different technology backgrounds.
- Community building 
- Project growth and management

## The problem to solve
While many cities, communities, and islands seek to improve their disaster resilience by identifying their critical assets, their efforts often suffer from disparate datasets and the inability to map relationships and dependencies between assets programmatically. CAMS is a simple, free software tool that:

- Enables cities and islands to fully inventory their critical assets and assemble key data about them;
- Identifies the risks to which each asset is exposed;
- Maps the relationships between assets, both spatial and dependency-based;
- Helps to identify potential “failure chains” between them and the risks involved;
- Provides this output to other tools such as emergency control room systems and risk analysis tools.

The tool will provide the functionality to enable communities and nations to improve their disaster resilience to save lives and repair societies faster.
