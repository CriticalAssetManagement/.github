# The Problem to Solve

Climate change is increasing the risk of extreme weather events all over the world. Island nations, cities, and communities are more vulnerable now than ever. Increased sea temperatures result in more ferocious and frequent storms. 

Governing bodies are actively looking at ways to improve their climate resilience. One such way is by understanding critica asset infrastructures so that first responders and decision makers can improve:

- Extreme weather response planning
- Critical asset resilience
- Rebuilding processes

## Understanding & Visualizing Critical Assets

While many cities, communities, and islands seek to improve their disaster resilience by identifying their critical assets, their efforts often suffer from disparate datasets and the inability to map relationships and dependencies between assets programmatically. CAMS is a simple software tool that:

- Enables cities and islands to fully inventory their critical assets and assemble key data about them;
- Identifies the risks to which each asset is exposed;
- Maps the relationships between assets, both spatial and dependency-based;
- Helps to identify potential “failure chains” between them and the risks involved;
- Provides this output to other tools such as emergency control room systems and risk analysis tools.

## What We'd Like to Become

A community-oriented map-based, disaster risk information and early warning service with customizable and automated tools to minimize disruptions in service continuity.

An open source map-based information service where users may superimpose assets over basic map data, latest versions of local/national hazard maps, real-time weather information, real-time hazard information, and so on. In addition to receiving early warnings pertaining to their asset, send and receive pre-set messages, alerts, etc. based on pre-set triggers to pre-set recipients, shortening response time, and thus contributing to faster recovery. We could contribute to existing local/national EWS by functioning as aggregator of EWS for decision-makers who must assess disaster risk/threats to extremely large numbers (thousands to tens of thousands) of assets across dispersed and discrete geographical locations.

A vast number of people globally are dependent of continuation of services for their livelihoods and will need this type of tooling more and more as the climate becomes less predictable. We think an open and independent service like CAMS could make a real difference to people's lives.
